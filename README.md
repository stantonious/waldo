# TCP server

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a TCP server with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU with AIROC&trade; CYW43xxx Wi-Fi & Bluetooth&reg; combo chips. In this example, the TCP server establishes a connection with a TCP client. After the successful connection, the server allows the user to send LED ON/OFF command to the TCP client and the client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server. Additionally, this code example can be configured to bring up the Wi-Fi device either in STA interface or Soft AP interface mode.

This example uses the Wi-Fi Core FreeRTOS lwIP mbedtls library of the SDK. This library enables application development based on Wi-Fi by pulling wifi-connection-manager, FreeRTOS, lwIP, mbed TLS, secure sockets, and other dependent modules. The secure sockets library provides an easy-to-use API by abstracting the network stack (lwIP) and the security stack (mbed TLS).

This example can be modified to use ThreadX and NetX Duo instead of FreeRTOS and lwIP. See the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section for more details.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ships with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

1. Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

2. Install a Python interpreter if you don't have one. This code example is tested using [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-wifi-tcp-server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-tcp-server)" application with the desired name "TcpServer" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062-4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --app-id mtb-example-wifi-tcp-server --user-app-name TcpServer --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/TcpServer" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/TcpServer" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

**Note:**  Use `policy_single_CM0_CM4_smif_swap.json` policy instead of using the default one "policy_single_CM0_CM4_swap.json" to provision CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W device.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. The kit can be configured to run either in the Wi-Fi STA or AP interface modes. Configure the interface mode using the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro defined in the *tcp_server.c* file. Based on the desired interface mode, do the following:

   **Kit in STA mode (default interface):**

   1. Set the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro to '0'; default mode.

   2. Modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match the Wi-Fi network credentials that you want to connect to in the *tcp_server.c* file. Ensure to configure your connecting Wi-Fi network as a private network for the proper functioning of this example.

   **Kit in AP mode:**

   1. Set the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro to '1'.

   2. (Optional) Update the `SOFTAP_SSID`, `SOFTAP_PASSWORD`, and `SOFTAP_SECURITY_TYPE` as desired.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

   **Figure 1. Wi-Fi interface in STA mode**

   ![](images/tcp-server-sta-pre-connection.png)

   <br />

   **Figure 2. Wi-Fi interface in AP mode**

   ![](images/tcp-server-ap-pre-connection.png)


5. Connect your PC to the Wi-Fi AP that you have configured in **Step 2**.

   - In STA mode: Connect the PC to the same AP to which the kit is connected.

   - In AP mode: Connect the PC to the kit's AP.

   Note the IP address assigned to the kit as shown in **Figure 1** (for STA mode) and **Figure 2** (for AP mode).

6. Open the *tcp_client.py* script located in the  *{project directory}* in a text editor and update the IP address with the IP address assigned to your kit (as noted in **Step 5**).

    For example, if the IP address assigned to your kit is `192.168.10.1`, update the following line in the *tcp_client.py* script:

    ```
    DEFAULT_IP   = '192.168.10.1'
    ```

7. From the project directory, open a command shell and run the Python TCP client (*tcp_client.py*). In the command shell opened in the project directory, type in the following command:

    ```
      python tcp_client.py
    ```

   **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your PC allow access to the Python software so that it can communicate with the TCP server. For more details on enabling Python access, see the [community thread](https://community.infineon.com/thread/53662).


8. Press the user button (CYBSP_USER_BTN) to send LED ON/OFF command to the Python TCP client. Each user button press will issue the LED ON/OFF commands alternately. The client, in turn, sends an acknowledgement message back to the server. **Figure 3** and **Figure 4** show the TCP server in STA and AP modes respectively. **Figure 5** shows the corresponding TCP client output.

   **Figure 3. TCP server output in STA mode**

   ![](images/tcp-server-sta-post-connection.png)

   <br />

   **Figure 4. TCP server output in AP mode**

   ![](images/tcp-server-ap-post-connection.png)

   <br />

   **Figure 5. TCP client output**

   ![](images/tcp-client-output.png)

   **Note:** Instead of using the Python TCP client (*tcp_client.py*), you can use the example [mtb-example-wifi-tcp-client](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-tcp-client) to run as the TCP client on a second kit. See the code example documentation.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings


**Table 1. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose     
 :------- | :------------    | :------------ 
 SDIO (HAL) | sdio_obj | SDIO interface for Wi-Fi connectivity 
 UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for the Debug UART port 
 BUTTON (BSP) | CYBSP_USER_BTN | User button to send LED ON/OFF commands to the TCP client 

<br />

This example uses the Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSoC&trade; 6 MCU to execute an RTOS task: TCP server task. At device reset, the default Cortex&reg;-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep.

In this example, the TCP server establishes a connection with a TCP client. After the successful connection, the server allows the user to send LED ON/OFF command to the TCP client; the client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server.

**Note:** The CY8CPROTO-062-4343W board shares the same GPIO for the user button (CYBSP_USER_BTN) and the CYW4343W host wakeup pin. Because this example uses the GPIO for interfacing with the user button, the SDIO interrupt to wake up the host is disabled by setting `CY_WIFI_HOST_WAKE_SW_FORCE` to '0' in the `Makefile` through the `DEFINES` variable.

### Using ThreadX and NetX Duo

This code example can be modified to use the ThreadX and NetX Duo instead of the default FreeRTOS and lwIP. All the source and configuration files required by both the RTOSes are already present in their COMPONENT_* folders. By default, the FreeRTOS and lwIP libraries are added as dependencies in this code example. Follow these steps to configure the code example to use ThreadX and NetX Duo instead.

<details><summary><b>Adding ThreadX and NetX Duo libraries</b></summary>

   1. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **Library Manger \<version>**.
   2. In the **Library Manager** window, delete the **wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls** library. This will delete all the dependent libraries as well.
   3. Click the **Add Library** button and add the following libraries back. This step requires a bundle repo for ThreadX, NetX Duo, and NetX Secure does not exist.
      ```
      abstraction-rtos
      clib-support
      connectivity-utilities
      netxduo-network-interface-integration
      secure-sockets
      whd-bsp-integration
      wifi-connection-manager
      wifi-host-driver
      ```
   4. Click **OK** and **Update**. After the libraries are updated, click **Close**.
   5. The ThreadX and NetX Duo libraries do not show up in the library manager as these are not distributed by Infineon. Add these libraries manually. To add the ThreadX library, create a file called *threadx.mtb* in the **deps** folder of the code example with the following content:
   ```
   https://github.com/azure-rtos/threadx#v6.1.5_rel#$$ASSET_REPO$$/threadx/v6.1.5_rel
   ```
   6. To add the NetX Duo library, create a file called *netxduo.mtb* in the **deps** folder with the following content:
   ```
   https://github.com/azure-rtos/netxduo#v6.2.0_rel#$$ASSET_REPO$$/netxduo/v6.2.0_rel
   ```
   7. From the Terminal window, execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch these libraries.

   </details>

<details><summary><b>Makefile changes</b></summary>

   1. Change the following lines from
   ```
   COMPONENTS=FREERTOS
   ```
   to
   ```
   COMPONENTS=THREADX
   ```
</details>

Follow the steps in the [Using the code example](#using-the-code-example) section to run this code example.

**Note:** NetXDuo network stack used with ThreadX does not have the option to dynamically configure the TCP keep alive parameters (interval, count, and idle time). Therefore, the secure sockets `cy_socket_setsockopt` function fails with an error code "CY_RSLT_MODULE_SECURE_SOCKETS_OPTION_NOT_SUPPORTED".

In the code example, you can skip `cy_socket_setsockopt` calls (except CY_SOCKET_SO_TCP_KEEPALIVE_ENABLE) related to TCP keepalive in the ThreadX environment. And you can configure the desired TCP keep alive parameters by changing the following defines in *nx_user.h* file:
```
NX_TCP_KEEPALIVE_RETRIES
NX_TCP_KEEPALIVE_INITIAL
NX_TCP_KEEPALIVE_RETRY
```

**Note:** The version of the code example currently supports ThreadX and the NetXDuo network stack in GCC_ARM toolchain only. Support for other toolchains will be added in a future version of the code example.
